# My Online Portfolio

This is a currently work in progress website. To access the page:
https://chnchan.github.io/Chun-Hin-Chan/

Using this website, I am hoping to further improve my web designing/programming
skills through revising and improving every detail on this website. There is always
place for improvement; therefore, this will most likely stay in work in progress
for more years to come.

My goal for this website is to have my work (either personal/work/school) to be
listed on here. I am even considering an independent page for each project; however,
I realized that may be overwhelming amount work. I may end up doing a Markdown for
each project with some pictures instead. Additionally, I am also hoping to see
how much I have improved since the last few demo websites that I have created.
